<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Vet Clinic Database <a name="about-project"></a>

This project contains the exercise files for the Basic Database Module of the Full Stack Developer Program offered by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/). It includes the SQL commands to create, modify and query tables in the database. We have used [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as the database engine - *a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over 35 years of active development*.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed on your machine. You can download the installer for your specific operating system [right here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

You also need to create a database user with permission to create and modify databases and tables.

Lastly, you will need a command line interface for interacting with the database.
### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

```sh
  cd my-folder
  git clone https://github.com/henokkhm/microverse-vet-clinic.git
```

### Usage

To run the SQL commands, first open the terminal. After starting the psql program and connecting to the database, you can run each SQL command by copy-pasting from the files schema.sql, data.sql and queries.sql into the command line.

Alternatively, you can use a GUI PostgreSQL client such as [Postbird](https://github.com/Paxa/postbird) to ease the process.
